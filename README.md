 ## Keylogger with Encryption in Python

### Disclaimer
This project was created solely for educational purposes as part of my personal journey to learn more about cybersecurity and Python programming. I am a beginner exploring how keylogging and encryption mechanisms work in a controlled and ethical environment.
Please do not use this code to monitor or log keystrokes on devices you do not have permission to test on. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.
This tool is intended for learning, experimentation, and responsible use only.

### Overview
This Python-based project is a keylogger that records keystrokes and saves them to a log file. The log file is then encrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption to ensure its confidentiality. The program also includes the ability to decrypt the log file when needed.

### Features
- Logs all keyboard input (including special keys like Enter, Tab, and Space)
- Saves logs to a timestamped .log file
- Encrypts the log file using Fernet (symmetric encryption)
- Option to decrypt the encrypted file for review
